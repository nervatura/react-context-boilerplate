# React Context API Boilerplate
A minimal React Context API boilerplate with all the best practices

## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

<a href="https://twitter.com/flexdinesh">Dinesh Pandiyan</a> made the great [react-redux-boilerplate](https://github.com/flexdinesh/react-redux-boilerplate). Quote from him:

>The whole React community knows and will unanimously agree that [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) is the ultimate starter template for kickstarting a React project. It's setup with all the industry best practices and standards. But it also has a lot more than what you just need to start a react-redux app. It took me quite some time to get my head around what was happening in the codebase and it's clearly not for starters.

>So it involves a lot of additional learning curve to get started with [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate). That's why I forked it, stripped it down and made this _leaner, **beginner friendly**_ boilerplate without all the additional complexity.

So I also forked it, and I made a **more beginner friendly** and simpler version. :-) Redux is really good, but the same codebase solved with [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html):
- less code complexity
- smaller build size
- and better performance


## Features

- base on [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) with **no build configuration**
- application state management with [React **Context API**](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
- performance optimization with [React **Code Splitting**](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html)
- [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests) **testing** with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) and [Test Renderer](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-renderer.html) packages
- Context API [**Redux Devtools** support](https://github.com/jhen0409/remotedev-react-state)
